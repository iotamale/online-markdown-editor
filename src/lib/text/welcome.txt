# Online Markdown Editor 
Just write in markdown and see what it looks like as you type. 
- The data is not sent to any server - everything is compiled on your client. 
- The editor automatically saves what you write locally for future use. If using a public computer, either empty the left panel before leaving the editor or use your browser's privacy mode

### Code Example

Here's some inline `code` and a code block:

```javascript
function hello() {
    console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
